# IA-Highway Mobile

IA-Highway is an application that provides a means of creating image datasets that can be used in intelligent computer vision algorithms to solve various problems such as image classification, detection, or segmentation. IA-Highway is part of an ambitious project that aims to optimize/automate the maintenance of road/rail/building infrastructures.
IA-Highway should allow a user to select/draw a region/polygon surrounding an object of interest, in this case, images of certain civil engineering structures that contain damages will be provided. After the selection process is done, the application should save the coordinates of the pixels that form the polygon in a convenient format (json, xml, database) as well as all the metadata that could be obtained from the image, such as width, height, GPS coordinates where the image was taken.
In addition to the metadata, IA-Highway must allow the user to add one or more tags related to the image and a description text. All this data must be stored as mentioned above.
